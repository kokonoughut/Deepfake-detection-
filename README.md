# Deepfake Detection Using Convolutional Vision Transformer (CViT)
## Overview
- This repository contains the implementation of a novel method for detecting deepfake videos using Convolutional Vision Transformer (CViT). Deepfake technology, powered by artificial intelligence, poses a significant threat to the trustworthiness and integrity of digital content by enabling the realistic manipulation of faces in videos.

## Methodology
-The proposed method combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to accurately classify videos as real or fake. It utilizes a 20-layer CNN to extract features from face images and a ViT for classification.
Additionally, the method employs MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Neural Network) for face detection and alignment, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the process.
